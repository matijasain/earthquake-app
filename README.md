### Used libraries/tools/packages:

Create-react-app

React - as this is a UI library I have most experience with, it was a logical choce

SemanticUI - In my opinion very nice framework for fast creation of (simple) layouts

Jest - Testing

Moment - Great package for making handling dates a bit easier

etc.

Possible further steps:
* Refactoring MainContainer component
* Write more detailed tests
